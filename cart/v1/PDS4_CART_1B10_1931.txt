    Contains classes and attributes used to describe cartographic
    products.  This information is largely adapted from the Federal Geographic 
	  Data Committee (FGDC) "Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata", 
	  with extensions (changes/additions) to satisfy planetary requirements.
    
    ## CHANGE LOG ##
    1.9.0.0
    - Upgraded to v1900 of the IM
    - Created new Map_Projection_Lander class with associated map projections and attributes
    - New pixel_scale attribute that defines a pixel scale not x/y aligned
    - Change units for pixel_scale_x/y to Units_of_Pixel_Scale_Map
    - Change units for pixel_resolution_x/y to Units_of_Pixel_Resolution_Map
    - Change local_georeference_information to optional in the case where Map_Projection_Lander is specified.
    - Created Local_child_check rule to check this
    - Change Spatial_Domain to optional in the case where Map_Projection_Lander is specified since domain is the horizon
    - Created spatial_domain_or_lander_check rule to check this
    - Added Local_Internal_Reference at top-level of Cartography dictionary
    - Created local_reference_type_check_cart rule to enforce value of Local_Internal_Reference
    
    1.9.0.1
    - Changed all class local_identifier to identifier_reference per v1900 IM update
    - Changed Coordinate_Space_Reference to inherit from Geometry dictionary
    
    1.9.0.2
    - CIsbell 24July2018
    - Added/corrected unit_of_measure_type where appropriate to correctly include 
      'Units_of_Pixel_Scale_Map' and 'Units_of_Pixel_Resolution_Map'
    
    1.9.1.0
    - Added Point Perspective Map Projection (CIsbell).
    - Note: As of 24July2018, parameters/attributes here include only those required to define the 'fundamental' Point Perspective (PP)
            Projection. That is, along with the common base projection parameters required for all projections, the additional PP
            requirements of target_center_distance and nadir point (longitude_of_central_meridian, latitude_of_projection_origin) 
            will define the basic PP projection. Additional parameters for a more 'complex' PP (line/sample sub-spacecraft offsets,
            optical offsets, focal parameters, image array segment definitions, etc, will need to be added as needed.

    1.9.1.1
    - CDeCesare 20181116
    - Removed definitions of classes which are already defined by GEOM dictionary: Vector_Cartesian_Unit_Base, Vector_Cartesian_Position_Base, Vector_Cartesian_No_Units
    - Updated references that point at Vector_Cartesian_Unit_Base to instead point at geom.Vector_Cartesian_Unit
    - Updated references that point at Vector_Cartesian_Position_Base to instead point at geom.Vector_Cartesian_Position_Base

    1.9.2.0
	PGeissler and THare 20181221
	- Added Oblique Cylindrical Map Projection 
    - Note: To support Cassini BIDR. This is a somewhat specialize map projection which requires several new projection parameters
            including: reference_latitude, reference_longitude, map_projection_rotation, oblique_proj_pole_latitude, 
			oblique_proj_pole_longitude, oblique_proj_pole_rotation, oblique_proj_x_axis_vector, oblique_proj_y_axis_vector, and
			oblique_proj_z_axis_vector. The original parameter center_latitude is now mapped to latitude_of_projection_origin and
			the original parameter center_longitude is now mapped to longitude_of_central_meridian. line, sample offsets are
			remapped into meters using upperleft_corner_x and upperleft_corner_y. 
    - Added many definitions for map projections (cartographic and lander). 
    - Removed "General Vertical Near-sided Projection" since it has functionally been replaced by "Point Perspective".
	
    1.9.3.0
    THare and PGeissler 20190424
    -  'Planar_Coordinate_Information' is no longer mandated to better support vector files. It should be added for images
    -  'cart.latitude_resolution' and 'cart:longitude_resolution' to be optional, not needed for vector GIS labels
    -  Added Secondary_Spatial_Domain as an optional or alternative method to list IAU recommended or historically used 
       bounding coordinate section to support both positive East and positive West systems in the same label.
    -  Rename all three radius parameter names. These were renamed to clarify the parameter names since the name 
       semi_major_radius is flawed and confusing as semi and radius both mean "half". This keyword should have
       originally been named semi_major_axis (as used by the Federal Geospatial Data Consortium [FGDC]). To better
       align with PDS version 3, we are moving these parameters names back to a_axis_radius, b_axis_radius, and 
       c_axis_radius. Thus we are renaming: 
   	   - semi_major_radius to a_axis_radius. 
	   - semi_minor_radius to b_axis_radius
	   - polar_radius to c_axis_radius
	   To be clear, most mapping applications call a_axis_radius the semi_major_axis and c_axis_radius the semi_minor_radius.
	   The b_axis_radius value is generally not seen in mapping applications which typical do not support triaxial definitions
	   for map projections. For most all cases, when a triaxial definition is defined, the IAU defines a best fit sphere. 
	   see: https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/groups/IAU-WGCCRE.
	   When a best-fit sphere or a body is already defined as a sphere, a single radius value will be listed across all three 
	   parameters a_axis_radius, b_axis_radius, and c_axis_radius. For an ellipse, the a_axis_radius and b_axis_radius will be
	   defined by a single radius value and a different (generally smaller) radius value for the c_axis_radius. Lastly, the
       default units for the these parameters was set to meters "m".
     
    THare and CDeCesare 20190430
    - Upgraded to v1B10 of IM.
    - Undid changes from 1.9.1.1.
    - Coordinate_Space_Reference is now re-used from the GEOM class as-is, so that CART doesn't need to re-implement it.

    THare 20190520
    - simple misspellings
    - updated definitions for Surface_Model_Parameters and Surface_Model_Planar, surface_model_type, 
	  Vector_Surface_Ground_Location, Vector_Surface_Normal

    THare and CDeCesare 20190613
    - updated line and sample attributes to allow for non-negate values under Camera_Model_Offset, 
      Pixel_Position_Nadir_Polar, Pixel_Position_Origin

   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The longitude_direction attribute identifies the direction of longitude (e.g. POSITIVE_EAST or POSITIVE_WEST) for a planet. The IAU definition for direction of positive longitude should be adopted: http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/groups/IAU-WGCCRE. Typically, for planets with prograde (direct) rotations, positive longitude direction is to the west. For planets with retrograde rotations, positive longitude direction is to the east. Generally the Positive West longitude_direction is used for planetographic systems and Positive East is used for planetocentric systems. If the data is defined with Spatial_Domain in a manner not recommended by the IAU, there is a optional Secondary_Spatial_Domain section to define a second set of bounding coordinates.

Because of tradition, the Earth, Sun, and Moon do not conform with this definition. Their rotations are direct and longitudes run both east and west 180 degree, or east 360 degree.
      Positive West - Positive West longitudes (i.e., longitudes measured positively to the west) will be used when the rotation is prograde (direct).

   description            The latitude_type attribute defines the type of latitude (planetographic, planetocentric) used within a cartographic product and as reflected in attribute values within associated PDS labels. For planets and satellites, latitude is measured north and south of the equator; north latitudes are designated as positive. The planetocentric latitude is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line from the center of the body. The planetographic latitude is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line that is normal to the body. In summary, both latitudes are equivalent on a sphere (i.e., equatorial radius equal to polar radius); however, they differ on an ellipsoid (e.g., Mars, Earth). For more on latitude_type, please see the IAU publication available here: http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/groups/IAU-WGCCRE

   permissible value - value meaning
      Albers Conical Equal Area - Projection is mathematically based on a cone that is conceptually secant on two parallels. No areal deformation. North or South Pole is represented by an arc. Retains its properties at various scales; individual maps can be joined along their edges. 
      Azimuthal Equidistant - Projection is mathematically based on a plane tangent to the body. The entire body can be represented. Generally the Azimuthal Equidistant map projection portrays less than one hemisphere, though the other hemisphere can be portrayed but is much distorted. Has true direction and true distance scaling from the point of tangency. 
      Equidistant Conic - Projection is mathematically based on a cone that is tangent at one parallel or conceptually secant at two parallels. North or South Pole is represented by an arc. 
      Equirectangular - Also called Equidistant Cylindrical, this projection is neither equal-area or conformal and is known for its very simple construction. Equations only allow spherical body definitions. The meridians and parallels are all equidistant straight parallel lines, intersecting at right angles. If the Equator is made the standard parallel, true to scale and free of distortion, the meridians are spaced at the same distances as the parallels, and the graticule appears square. This form is often called the Plate Carree or the Simple Cylindrical projection.
      Gnomonic - This projection is geometrically projected onto a plane, and the point of projection is at the center of the body. It is impossible to show a full hemisphere with one Gnomonic map. It is the only projection in which any straight line is a great circle, and it is the only projection that shows the shortest distance between any two points as a straight line. 
      Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area - The Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area projection is mathematically based on a plane tangent to the body. It is the only projection that can accurately represent both areas and true direction from the center of the projection. This projection generally represents only one hemisphere.
      Lambert Conformal Conic - Projection is mathematically based on a cone that is tangent at one parallel or (more often) that is conceptually secant on two parallels. Areal distortion is minimal but increases away from the standard parallels. North or South Pole is represented by a point; the other pole cannot be shown. Great circle lines are approximately straight. It retains its properties at various scale and maps can be joined along their edges.
      Mercator - Projection can be thought of as being mathematically based on a cylinder tangent at the equator. Any straight line is a constant-azimuth (rhumb) line. Areal enlargement is extreme away from the equator; poles cannot be represented. Shape is true only within any small area. Reasonably accurate projection within a 15 degree band along the line of tangency. 
      Miller Cylindrical - Similar to Mercator, this projection is neither equal-area or conformal. Equations only allow spherical body definitions. The meridians and parallels are straight lines, intersecting at right angles. Meridians are equidistant and parallels are spaced farther apart away from Equator. Generally used for global maps.
      Oblique Cylindrical - This projection works by moving the north pole of the simple cylindrical projection. The pole latitude and longitude are the location of the new north pole, and the rotation is the equivalent to the center longitude in simple cylindrical. Because of the supported rotation parameter, this projection is pretty uniquely used in the planetary community and it is implemented in USGS's Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers v2/3 (ISIS3) suite.
      Oblique Mercator - The projection is mathematically based on a cylinder tangent along any great circle other than the equator or a meridian. Shape is true only within any small area. Areal enlargement increases away from the line of tangency. Reasonably accurate projection within a 15 degree band along the line of tangency.
      Orthographic - The Orthographic projection is geometrically based on a plane tangent to the earth, and the point of projection is at infinity. The body appears as it would from outer space. This projection is a truly graphic representation of the body and is a projection in which distortion becomes a visual aid. It is the most familiar of the azimuthal map projections. Directions from the center of the Orthographic map projection are true.
      Point Perspective - Simimlar to Orthographic, this projection is often used to show the body as seen from space. This appears to be the same as the the Vertical Perspective projection as define in Synder, J.P., 1987, Map Projections: A Working Manual. Vertical Perspective projections are azimuthal. Central meridian and a particular parallel (if shown) are straight lines. Other meridians and parallels are usually arcs of circles or ellipses, but some may be parabolas or hyperbolas. This is neither conformal or equal-area.
      Polar Stereographic - Related to the Stereographic projection but generally centered directly at the North or South Pole of the body. This resembles other polar azimuthals, with straight radiating meridians and concentric circles for parallels. The parallels are spaced at increasingly wide distances the farther the latitude is from the pole. 
      Polyconic - Projection is mathematically based on an infinite number of cones tangent to an infinite number of parallels. Distortion increases away from the central meridian. Has both areal and angular deformation.
      Robinson - Also called orthophanic, Robinson is a compromise projection used for global maps. Meridians are equally spaced and resemble elliptical arcs, concave toward the central meridian. The poles are 0.53 times the length of the equator.
      Sinusoidal - Projection is mathematically based on a cylinder tangent on the equator. Meridian spacing is equal and decreases toward the poles. Parallel spacing is equal. There is no angular deformation along the central meridian and the equator. Cannot be edge-joined in an east-west direction if each map has its own central meridian.
      Space Oblique Mercator - The Space Oblique Mercator (SOM) projection visually differs from the Oblique Mercator projection in that the central line (the ground-track of the orbiting satellite) is slightly curved, rather than straight.
      Stereographic - The Stereographic projection is geometrically projected onto a plane, and the point of the projection is on the surface of the sphere opposite the point of tangency. Circles on the body appear as straight lines, parts of circles, or circles on the projection. Directions from the center of the stereographic map projection are true. Generally only one hemisphere is portrayed.
      Transverse Mercator - Projection is mathematically based on a cylinder tangent to a meridian. Shape is true only within any small area. Areal enlargement increases away from the tangent meridian. Reasonably accurate projection within a 15 degree band along the line of tangency. Cannot be edge-joined in an east-west direction if each map has its own central meridian.
      van der Grinten - The projection has both areal and angular deformation. It was conceived as a compromise between the Mercator and the Mollweide projection, which shows the world in an ellipse. The Vander Grinten shows the world in a circle.

      Universal Transverse Mercator - The UTM is the ellipsoidal Transverse Mercator to which specific parameters, such as central meridians, have been applied. This is generally used for Earth. The Earth, between lats. 84 degrees North and 80 degrees South, is divided into 60 zones each generally 6 degrees wide in longitude. Bounding meridians are evenly divisible by 6 degrees, and zones are numbered from 1 to 60 proceeding east from the 180th meridian from Greenwich with minor exceptions.
      Universal Polar Stereographic - Like Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), UPS is a method to split up the Earth into quads. When the latitude is from 84 degrees North and 80 degrees South to the respective poles, the (UPS) projection is used.
      State Plane Coordinate System 1927 - In the United States, it is the projection used in the State Plane Coordinate System (SPCS) for States with predominant north-south extent. (The Lambert Conformal Conic is used for the others, except for the panhandle of Alaska, which is prepared on the Oblique Mercator. Alaska, Florida, and New York use both the Transverse Mercator and the Lambert Conformal Conic for different zones.) Except for narrow States, such as Delaware, New Hampshire, and New Jersey, all States using the Transverse Mercator are divided into two to eight zones, each with its own central meridian, along which the scale is slightly reduced to balance the scale throughout the map. Each zone is designed to maintain scale distortion within 1 part in 10,000. 1927 refers to the use of the 1927 North American Datum (NAD27).
      State Plane Coordinate System 1983 - In the United States, it is the projection used in the State Plane Coordinate System (SPCS) for States with predominant north-south extent.

The inclusion of both x and y attributes allows for anticipated products where resolution may differ for each axis ('rectangular' pixels).

   description            The map_projection_name attribute provides the name of the map projection.
   permissible value - value meaning
      Cylindrical - This is an in-situ projection used for (non-stereo) panoramas. Each image row represents a constant elevation and each image column represents a constant azimuth, from a given point of view. The image scale in degrees per pixel is constant across the image. 
      Vertical - This is an in-situ projection that provides an overhead view. By projecting to a surface model, the need for range data is eliminated, but significant layover effects can happen when the actual geometry does not match the surface model. It has a constant scale in meters/pixel, subject to layover distortion. 
      Perspective - This is an in-situ projection that models a pinhole camera. 
      Polar - This is an in-situ projection that provides a quasi-overhead view that extends to the horizon. Elevation is measured radially outward from the nadir location, with a constant pixel scale. Azimuth is measured along concentric circles centered at the nadir.
      Orthographic - This is an in-situ projection that is a generalization of the Vertical projection, in that any arbitrary projection plane can be specified.
      Orthorectified - This is an in-situ projection that provides a true overhead view of the scene. Range data is required to create this projection, meaning there is no parallax distortion. It has a constant scale in meters/pixel.
      Cylindrical_Perspective - This is an in-situ projection that is a hybrid. Each column is a vertical slice from a pinhole camera (Perspective projection), while the columns are spaced evenly in azimuth (Cylindrical projection). It is most useful for viewing panoramas in stereo.

The SAR images stored in theBIDR files are always acquired on only one side of the ground track for each Titan pass. This value also indicates from which side the SAR image is illuminated. If the spacecraft images to the left of its ground track (LOOK_DIRECTION=LEFT), the image will be illuminated from the (viewer's) left side, and, conversely, if the spacecraft looks to the right, the illumination will come from the right in the image file. The direction of illumination is critical to interpretation of features in the image. 
   permissible value - value meaning
      LEFT - Antenna pointed left of spacecraft ground-track
      RIGHT - Antenna pointed right of spacecraft groundtrack

   description            The Vector_Projection_Origin class specifies the location of the origin of the projection. For Polar and Cylindrical projections, this is the XYZ point from which all the azimuth/elevation rays emanate. For the Cylindrical-Perspective projection, this defines the center of the circle around which the synthetic camera orbits. For Orthographic, Orthorectified, and Vertical projections, this optional keyword specifies the point on the projection plane that serves as the origin of the projection (i.e. all points on a line through this point in the direction of PROJECTION_Z_AXIS_VECTOR will be located at X=Y=0 in the projection). If not present, (0,0,0) should be assumed. This translation is generally not necessary and not often used; the (X|Y)_AXIS_MINIMUM and (X|Y)_AXIS_MAXIMUM fields allow the mosaic to be located arbitrarily in the projection plane.

For Orthographic, Orthorectified, and Vertical projections, this vector defines the projection axis for the mosaic. All points along a line parallel to this axis are projected to the same spot in the projection plane. For the Cylindrical-Perspective projections, this defines the new axis of the circle around which the synthetic camera orbits (i.e. the normal to the circle), after the cameras have been rotated to correct for rover tilt. CAMERA_ROTATION_AXIS_VECTOR contains the axis before rotation; the difference in these two indicate the rotation amount.

   name                   Geo_Transformation
   description            The GEO_Transformation describes the relationship between raster positions (in pixel/line coordinates) and georeferenced coordinates. This is defined by an affine transform. The affine transform consists of six coefficients which map pixel/line coordinates into georeferenced space using the following relationship: Xgeo = GT(0) + Xpixel*GT(1) + Yline*GT(2) Ygeo = GT(3) + Xpixel*GT(4) + Yline*GT(5) or also defined as: GT[0] = Xmin; // upperleft_corner_y GT[1] = CellSize in X; // W-E pixel size, pixel_resolution_x GT[2] = 0; // rotation term, 0 if 'North Up' GT[3] = Ymax; // upperleft_corner_y GT[4] = 0; // shear term, 0 if 'North Up' GT[5] = CellSize in Y; // N-S pixel size, pixel_resolution_y In case of north up images, the GT(2) and GT(4) coefficients are zero, and the GT(1) is pixel width (pixel_resolution_x), and GT(5) is pixel height (pixel_resolution_y). The (GT(0),GT(3)) position is the top left corner of the top left pixel of the raster. Note that the pixel/line coordinates in the above are from (0.5,0.5) at the top left corner of the top left pixel to (width_in_pixels,height_in_pixels) at the bottom right corner of the bottom right pixel. The pixel/line location of the center of the top left pixel would therefore be (1.0,1.0).
