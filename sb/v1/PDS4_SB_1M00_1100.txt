   Comment                
    The Small Bodies namespace provides classes and attributes for describing techniques 
    and metadata common in small bodies observations, space-based or ground-based. In
    some cases this metadata is in addition to the more general classes and attributes
    provided in other discipline namespaces, which is expected to be present.
    
    The initials "ACR" in the "submitter" field indicate Anne Raugh.

    version 1.1.0 2024-06-23
     - Added dead_time_correction, effective_area_correction, smear_removal_applied, and
       wavelength_solution_applied attributes, which are boolean checks that should be
       present if their respective calibration steps have been applied to the data product.
     - Updated Calibration_Applied class to allow for the above attributes.
     - Added Desmear_Matrix, Effective_Area_Table, and Wavelength_Solution classes, which
       are containers providing a file_name and Internal_Reference to the calibration
       product associated with a particular calibration process.
     - Updated Calibration_Reference_File class to allow for the above classes.
     - Added schematron rules specifying the reference_type used in pds:Internal_Reference
       for the above classes.
     - Added x_axis_position_angle attribute to Instrument_Position_Angles class along
       with schematron rules requiring exactly 2 of the 3 attributes in that class.

   description             The sb:effective_area_correction attribute should be present and contain the value "true" if effective area correction based on the calculated effective area of the instrument due to varying sensitivity has been performed as part of the processing applied to the data comprising the product. 

   name                   exposure_description
   version                1.22
   value data type        UTF8_Text_Preserved
   description             The exposure_description attribute should be used, typically in conjunction with the exposure_duration attribute, when the data collection process involves something other than simple photon collection over a continuous period of time. The exposure_description should define what constitutes as "exposure", and/or how the "duration" is determined. 

   name                   exposure_duration
   version                1.22
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description             As in the Imaging namespace, exposure_duration indicates the total time a detector was exposed to or gathering a "signal". This element is used in cases where non-standard imaging techniques (those not described by the Imaging dictionary) are used, or when the detector is detecting something other than photons. 
   minimum value          0.0

   name                   file_name
   version                1.22
   value data type        ASCII_File_Name
   description             The sb:file_name attribute should contain the name, preferably without path information, of the file referenced more formally by a pds:Internal_Reference class in the same containing class. The file name is provided as a matter of convenience and for use as a validation cross-check when the data are accepted for archiving. Path information is unlikely to be useful once the data are archived, and as the data are curated both paths and file names may change. Consequently, the logical identifier appearing in the pds:Internal_Reference should be considered the positive identification of the file in question within the archive, rather than the name. 

   name                   filter_name
   version                1.22
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description             The filter_name is a (frequently informal) identifier for the filter within the context of the source data collection. Typical values will be things like "Red", "Clear", or "CH4". Values should be simple ASCII strings.

   name                   flags_are_bit_flags
   version                1.22
   value data type        ASCII_Boolean
   description             The sb:flag_are_bit_flags attribute contains "true" if the flags being defined within the containing class correspond to specific bits within a single integer field. When this is the case, all flag should have values that are exponents of 2. Typically, when bit flags are used, several flags may be combined within a single field (so a quality value may be 10, indicating that the flags corresponding to the values 8 and 2 are both set, for example).

   value data type        ASCII_Integer
   description             The sb:frame_number attribute specifies the sequential frame number, starting with "0", to which the subsequent frame-specific metadata applies. The frame number is the subscript along the axis that defines the "frame" dimension. Frames must be physically stored in sequence in the file, so for a sequence of 2D frames the sb:frame_number will correspond to the (0-based) index along the third axis. 
   minimum value          0

   name                   image_observation_type
   version                1.22
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description             The sb:image_observation_type attribute indicates whether the data product is a single, 2D image, or an image "frame sequence" - a series of images obtained in a single observing sequence and processed as a set. If the images were intended to comprise a spectral cube or an movie sequence, then the data should be labeled accordingly and this class may not be present if there is no additional metadata needed. Additiona types can be added to the permissible value list as needs arise. When in doubt, check with the PDS node curating the data or raise an issue on this dictionary.

   name                   Geometry_Vector_Time
   description             The sb:Geometry_Vector_Time class identifies a vector or pair of related vectors included in the geom:Geometry_Orbiter class and provides details about the local time for an observer located at one of the endpoints of the vector at the time for which the vector was calculated. For example, if the geom:Vector_Cartesian_Position_Earth_to_Target vector was calculated for spacecraft UTC timeX, this class can be used to provide the additional information that the UTC time for an Earth Observer at that instant would have been timeY.

   name                   Instrument_Position_Angles
   description             The sb:Instrument_Position_Angles class provide position angles for the axes of the boresight on the place of the image, measured with respect to the location of the celestial North pole (also projected onto the plane of the image). Only two axes should be specified, with the third being the instrument's boresight. Note that the instrument frame's axis orientation is assumed to be right-handed, so the direction of the boresight axis (into or out of the image plane) can be inferred from the relative positions of the other two.
