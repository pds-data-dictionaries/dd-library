   description            The delayed_readout_flag element provides an indication of whether or not an image had to remain stored on a CCD while some some other instrument function was taking place. Note: for Cassini, the delay in the image readout is due to the readout of the alternate camera image from the CCD.

   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The pds3_product_version_type element provides the instrument teams internal version type of the original PDS3 products. In products submitted to PDS, the only value for this keyword is FINAL. This attribute is included in the PDS4 label for historical reasons.

   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The pds3_target_desc element provides the value for TARGET_DESC given in the PDS3 label. The name of the intended target for which the exposure was calculated/selected in the given image. May include calibration type information. This frequently provides a more accurate clue to the actual target than does the PDS3 keyword TARGET_NAME. For many observations (e.g., those targeted at the rings) neither gives the correct information). 

   name                   pds3_target_list
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The pds3_target_list element corresponds to TARGET_LIST in the PDS3 label. TARGET_LIST was intended to provide a list of all known targets in the image field-of-view. However this was not provided, so the only value for this keyword is N/A. This attribute is included in the PDS4 label for historical reasons. For lists of all know targets in the FoV of each image see the *_inventory.tab files in this collection (* is either cruise or saturn).

   description            The pds3_target_name element provides the value for TARGET_NAME given in the PDS3 label. The name of the intended target based on the Predicted Events File (PEF). For many observations the value is not the actual target (e.g., it may indicate Saturn, while the observation was of some other target based on an offset from Saturn). The most accurate, though potentially flawed identification of the intended target is given in the Target_Identification class elsewhere in the label. This attribute is included in the PDS4 label for historical reasons.

   value data type        ASCII_Integer
   description            The pre-pds_version_number element provides the version number product used internally by the provider. For ISS, the value was included in the PDS3 product filenames, but is not included in the PDS4 filenames. This attribute preserves the information primarily for historical reasons since only one of the internal versions of any ISS product was delivered to PDS. The internal versions were used because the same image may have been built multiple times due to multiple downlinks, or multiple TDS queries, etc. In every case, the best available internal version was the version submitted to PDS.

Expressed in UTC format, and includes subRTI resolution. (A subRTI is approximately 4 msec (1/256 second)). When the shutter was inhibited (ie SHUTTER_STATE_ID=”DISABLED”), the START_TIME = STOP_TIME, and both represent the start of the exposure window during the prepare cycle of the image. This value corresponds to the value for start_date_time given in the Time Coordinates section of the label in the year day-of-year format of the original PDS3 label.

   description            The fast_hk_item_name element provides the names of the housekeeping items which were collected. Fast housekeeping is a partial gathering of the available engineering data values, or items, that pertain to and describe the condition of the instrument itself. Note: For Cassini, up to four items can be collected, via fast housekeeping, and stored in the band suffix, or backplane, of the spectral cube. The fast housekeeping value will always supercede the slow housekeeping value, if present. If fast housekeeping is not used, this item will not be present in the PDS3 label. This PDS3 keyword was an ordered multi-valued list, with the position in the list corresponding to the position of the backplane (first item indicates the what information is stored in the first backplane). For PDS4, this keyword has been replaced by multiple specific attributes. Following is a list of PDS3 keyword position indicies and the corresponding PDS4 attribute.

   description            The fast_hk_item_name_1 element provides the name of the housekeeping item which was collected and stored in the first plane of band suffix array (backplanes). If fast housekeeping is not used, this item will have a value of 'not used'.

Fast housekeeping is a partial gathering of the available engineering data values, or items, that pertain to and describe the condition of the instrument itself. Note: For Cassini, this value (n) is stored in the band suffix, or backplane, of the spectral cube for the infrared channel. If (n) is set to zero, then housekeeping values will be collected at every pixel (i.e., every pixel of the backplane will have a value). If (n) is set from 1 to swath_length, then housekeeping values will be collected every nth line (i.e., only the first pixel of every nth line of the backplane will have a value). If no infrared housekeeping items were selected for the cube, then this keyword will not be present.

   description            The missing_pixels element provides the number of pixels missing from an image or observation. Note: For Cassini, this refers to the core of a spectral cube, which indicates that the expected number of pixels (as determined by the commanded cube dimensions) did not arrive.
