A planned reset of the on-board clock of the MESSENGER spacecraft occurred on January 8, 2013. This was commanded by Mission Operations and was done because the integer seconds part of the on-board mission- elapsed-time (MET) counter is not long enough to contain the larger MET values that would occur due to the extended mission. The MESSENGER team elected to command the clock reset and set MET to a small non-zero value to prevent disruptions in on-board timekeeping and other effects (that might have occurred if the clock were allowed to automatically rollover to 0 in early 2013) and to ensure that the MET counter would accomodate the remaining extended mission. As a result of the spacecraft clock reset, a discontinuity was introduced and MET values are no longer guaranteed to be unique throughout the mission. This ambiguity is resolved in ground processing by the use of SPICE 'clock partitions' (partition 1 for pre-reset METs and partition 2 for post-reset METs) in the Spacecraft Clock (SCLK) kernel (which supports mapping MET to other time forms using SPICE routines as described below) and with MET values stored in PDS products, labels, and for some instruments, product file names. For MET values in products or labels, a '1/' or '2/' preceding MET indicates the partition, as in: SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT = '1/265485874' SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_STOP_COUNT = '2/000100005' When using SPICE routines, clock partition numbers should be included with MET input values. METs expressed without an explicit partition number are associated with clock partition 1 by default.
