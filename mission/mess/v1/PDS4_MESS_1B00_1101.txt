   version                1.11
   value data type        ASCII_NonNegative_Integer
   description            The orbit_number attribute identifies the number of the orbital revolution of a spacecraft around a target body. For MESSENGER, the orbit number was incremented at apoapsis. For observations made before the spacecraft was in orbit, orbit_number has no value, and its nilReason attribute is "inapplicable".

   name                   spacecraft_clock_start_count
   version                1.11
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The spacecraft_clock_start_count attribute provides the value of the spacecraft clock at the beginning of a time period of interest. A planned reset of the on-board clock of the MESSENGER spacecraft occurred on January 8, 2013. This was commanded by Mission Operations and was done because the integer seconds part of the on-board mission- elapsed-time (MET) counter is not long enough to contain the larger MET values that would occur due to the extended mission. The MESSENGER team elected to command the clock reset and set MET to a small non-zero value to prevent disruptions in on-board timekeeping and other effects (that might have occurred if the clock were allowed to automatically rollover to 0 in early 2013) and to ensure that the MET counter would accomodate the remaining extended mission. As a result of the spacecraft clock reset, a discontinuity was introduced and MET values are no longer guaranteed to be unique throughout the mission. This ambiguity is resolved in ground processing by the use of SPICE 'clock partitions' (partition 1 for pre-reset METs and partition 2 for post-reset METs) in the Spacecraft Clock (SCLK) kernel (which supports mapping MET to other time forms using SPICE routines as described below) and with MET values stored in PDS products, labels, and for some instruments, product file names. For MET values in products or labels, a '1/' or '2/' preceding MET indicates the partition, as in: SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT = '1/265485874' SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_STOP_COUNT = '2/000100005' When using SPICE routines, clock partition numbers should be included with MET input values. METs expressed without an explicit partition number are associated with clock partition 1 by default. Use of clock partition numbers in file names for some MDIS products is described in the MDIS EDR and CDR/RDR SIS documents with those data sets.

   description            The background brightness used for MDIS automatic exposure time calculation. In a test image that it analyzed to determine an exposure time using automatic exposure, DPU hardware generates a histogram of the image. The histogram is analyzed by the software to determine if the image is overexposed or underexposed, and the exposure time is adjusted accordingly by analyzing the histogram of raw DN values in different brightness bins. The background or dark current level (mess.mdis.aex_bacb) is taken into account an is assumed to be a constant value. A threshold of number of pixels (mess.mdis.aex_sthr) is allowed to exceed a target brightness (mess.mdis.aex_tgtb). Starting with the maximum value, the number of pixels exceeding the target is counted, and the brightness of the histogram bin in which that threshold is reached (mess.mdis.aex_stat) is reported. The exposure time is scaled back by the ratio of mess.mdis.aex_tgtb/mess.mdis.aex_stat.

   description            Camera temperature 2 in raw counts. The meaning depends on whether it is being reported by the WAC or NAC. A single telemetry point is used to return the raw value of filter wheel temperature (WAC), FILTER_TEMPERATURE once converted to units of degrees Celsius, or the raw value of telescope temperature (NAC), OPTICS_TEMPERATURE once converted to units of degrees Celsius, depending on which camera is in use. For the WAC, this is temperature of the filter wheel. Thus, FILTER_TEMPERATURE is 'N/A' if the NAC was used for the observation because the telemetry point will be a measurement of the NAC telescope temperature. For the WAC the conversion from raw counts to degrees Celsius is: T = -292.7603 + Raw * 0.5553 where Raw is the raw counts in MESS:CAM_T2. For the NAC, this is temperature of the NAC telescope. Thus OPTICS_TEMPERATURE is 'N/A' if the WAC was used for observation because the telemetry point will be a measurement of the WAC filter wheel temperature. For the NAC the conversion from raw counts to degrees Celsius is: T = -269.7180 + Raw * 0.4861 where Raw is the raw counts in telemetry (mess.mdis.cam_t2).

   description            12 to 8 bit compression algorithm (0-7) used to compress images from 12 to 8 bits. Whether this option is enabled is indicated by mess.mdis.comp12_8. The compression is implemented using one of eight lookup tables, which are optimized to the lower WAC CCD read noise and higher NAC read noise, light levels, and bias level (nominal or after inflight drift). 
   permissible value - value meaning
      0 - Low-noise hi-bias SNR proportional. Case: Either NAC or WAC, for nominal bias (all DNs greater than 12-bit 230). Formulation: Maps 12-bit DNs between bias and saturation into 8 bits, proportional to SNR. Information loss is spread evenly over dynamic range. Usage: Typical imaging with varied brightness.
      1 - Low-noise hi-bias DN-weighted SNR proportional. Case: Low-noise (WAC) CCD, bias nominal (all DNs greater than 12-bit 230). Formulation: Maps 12 bits between bias and saturation into 8 bits proportional to sliding scale. Information is preferentially retained at the low DN end. Usage: Faint objects. Saturates at a DN of 3000.
      2 - High-noise hi-bias DN-weighted SNR proportional. Case: High-noise (NAC) CCD, bias nominal (all DNs greater than 12-bit 230). Formulation: Maps 12 bits between bias and saturation into 8 bits proportional to sliding scale. Information is preferentially retained at the low DN end. Usage: B/W, mostly low brightness.
      3 - Low-noise med-bias SNR proportional. Case: Either CCD, assuming bias has dropped tens DN (all DNs greater than 12-bit 180). Formulation: Maps 12-bit DNs between bias and saturation into 8 bits, proportional to SNR. Information loss is spread over dynamic range. Usage: Typical imaging, varied brightness.
      4 - Low-noise med-bias DN-weighted SNR proportional. Case: Lo-noise (WAC) CCD, assuming bias has dropped tens DN (all DNs greater than 12-bit 180). Formulation: Maps 12 bits between bias and saturation into 8 bits proportional to sliding scale. Information retained at low DN end. Usage: Faint objects. Saturates at a DN of 3000.
      5 - High-noise med-bias DN-weighted SNR proportional. Case: High-noise (NAC) CCD, assuming bias has dropped tens DN (all DNs greater than 12-bit 180). Formulation: Maps 12 bits between bias and saturation into 8 bits proportional to sliding scale. Information is retained preferentially at the low end of the DN range. Usage: B/W, mostly low brightness.
      6 - Zero-bias SNR proportional. Case: Contingency; assuming bias decreased to near 0 from the nominal 230 12-bit DNs. Formulation: Maps 12-bit DNs between bias and saturation into 8 bits, proportional to SNR. Information loss is spread over the dynamic range. Usage: Typical imaging, varied brightness.
      7 - Linear. Case: either CCD, bias or read noise. Formulation: Maps 12-bit DNs between the bias level and saturation linearly into 8-bit space. Usage: High brightness mapping; information loss greatest at low DNs, preserves information at high DNs.

      Photometry - Orbital color WAC observations that repeatedly cover representative areas at wide variety of incidence, emission, and phase angles, initially using the same 8-color filter set as for the global 8-color map. Images of the same target are taken multiple times, as the planet's rotation varies the incidence angle as the target region moves from the terminator to near the sub-solar longitude. Later in the mission the number of filters was increased to 11 to improve photometric correction of 11-color targeted observations.

      Three Color - Part of global 3-color mapping in the extended mission with a goal of near-nadir pointing and low solar incidence angle, with less pixel binning and thus higher spatial resolution than the 8-color map.
      Thermal Calibration - WAC clear filter star images taken every several months over one orbit, in groups with multiple pivot positions, to track thermally-driven elastic deformation of the spacecraft between the MDIS base and star cameras.
      Vulcanoid Search - WAC clear filter image of space near the ecliptic plane interior to Mercury's orbit, taken as part of a search for vulcanoid asteroids.

   description            Pivot control state of MDIS. A resolver provides a position reading of the pivot platform. The resolver only covers 45 degrees of motion; the resolver read-out values repeat eight times over the entire 360 degrees that an unconstrained platform could travel. The DPU software must determine in which of the eight octants the platform is located before the resolver reading is meaningful. The software combines the octant with the resolver reading to form a position that covers the entire 360 degrees. To determine the octant the DPU software must be commanded to 'home' the platform. To home the pivot platform, the software drives the motor open loop backwards into the hard stop at -185 degrees. Then the software drives the motor forward, open loop, prepositioning it to -179 degrees. Until homing is completed, the pivot platform is considered 'lost' and all other pivot commands will remain pending. This status item describes that state of the pivot in determining this position knowledge.
