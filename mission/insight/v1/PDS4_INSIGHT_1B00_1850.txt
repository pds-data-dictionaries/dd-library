   permissible value - value meaning
      ATLO - The ATLO mission phase (Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations) is the time of spacecraft and instrument assembly and test. During this phase data products are generated using flight hardware. They are usually not part of the final PDS archive but may be used for testing and peer review. 
      CRUISE - The cruise mission phase is from the time of escape from Earth's orbit through the time of entry into Mars' orbit. Some data products may be generated during this time, including instrument checkout data.
      DEVELOPMENT - The development mission phase refers to the period of data processing software development and testing, before instruments are integrated with the spacecraft. Data products generated during this phase are usually not part of the final PDS archive but may be used for testing and peer review.
      SURFACE MISSION - The surface mission phase is the time from arrival at Mars through the end of surface operations, including the primary mission and any extended missions that may take place.
      TEST - The test mission phase is not a time period but a placeholder for the mission_phase_name value, used for data products generating during all project tests such as ORTs, SVTs and thread tests. Data products generated in this way are usually not part of the final PDS archive but may be used for testing and peer review.

   value data type        ASCII_File_Name
   description             SEIS data products are archived in their native SEED format and in a PDS-compatible ASCII format. The ascii_equivalent_file_name attribute gives the name of the file that is the ASCII equivalent of a SEED format file.

   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            A SEIS data product contains data from a single location and single instrument channel. The channel_name uniquely identifies the location and channel pair using the format NN.AAA, where NN is a two-digit location number and AAA is a three-character channel code (letters or digits). The complete list of channel names may be found in the Channel Naming document in the SEIS document collection.

   version                1.11
   value data type        ASCII_File_Name
   description             SEIS observations are stored with the seismic data from the instrument in one file (mini-SEED or GeoCSV format) and the metadata for the measurements in another file (dataless SEED or StationXML format). The metadata_file_name attribute gives the name of the file containing the metadata associated with a given data file. 

   name                   sample_count
   version                1.11
   value data type        ASCII_Integer
   description            Sample_count is the number of samples in a SEIS mini-SEED or GeoCSV product.

   name                   sampling_rate
   version                1.11
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            Sampling_rate represents the number of samples per second (local on-board seconds). Because the instrument (EBox) clock drift is dependent on temperature, sampling_rate various over UTC time. However, this variation is small enough so as to be negligible and can be ignored for scientific analyses. 
   unit of measure type   Units_of_Frequency

   description             SEIS data products are archived in their native SEED format and in a PDS-compatible ASCII format. The seed_file_name attribute gives the name of the file that is the SEED equivalent of an ASCII data file. 

   name                   seis_data_type
   version                1.11
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            SEIS mini-SEED products and their equivalent GeoCSV products contain only seismic data, and therefore have the seis_data_type "waveform". SEIS dataless SEED products and their equivalent StationXML products contain only metadata for the seismic data files, and therefore have the seis_data_type "metadata". 
   permissible value - value meaning
      metadata - The data product contains only metadata.
      waveform - The data product contains only seismic data.

   name                   seis_waveform_type
   version                1.11
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            SEIS mini-SEED products and their equivalent GeoCSV products contain either continuous data, with one data product per UTC day, or event data, with one data product per event. An event may last several minutes. Continuous data products have seis_waveform_type "continuous". Event data products have seis_waveform_type "event". 
   permissible value - value meaning
      continuous - The data product contains continuous seismic data.
      event - The data product contains event seismic data.

   name                   signal_name
   version                1.11
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The signal name is a short descriptive English name corresponding to a combination of SEIS channel code and location code. There are more than 1000 such combinations.
