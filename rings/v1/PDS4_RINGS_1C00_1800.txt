    	  An issue within LDDTool means that currently the tool does not
    	  support referencing classes or attributes from other Discipline namespaces
    	  A fix to LDDTool is in work, but in the interim we borrow classes and 
    	  attributes from the geometry dictionary and redefine them here. The 
    	  blocks of such borrowed classes and attributes are preceded and followed 
    	  by xml comments which include '@@@'

          	
    	2018 07-17 

    	Classes borrowed from the geom namespace
    	  - Body_Ident_Base       -->   Body_Ident_Base      
    	  - Frame_Ident_Base      -->   Frame_Ident_Base     
    	  - Reference_Frame_Ident -->   Reference_Frame_Ident
    	  - Central_Body_Ident    -->   Central_Body_Ident   
    	  - Display_Direction

    	attributes borrowed from the geom namespace
    	  - body_spice_name
    	  - frame_spice_name
        - horizontal_display_axis
        - horizontal_display_direction
        - vertical_display_axis
        - vertical_display_direction

      Once LDDTool is repaired the preceding classes and attributes will be
      removed and the following will be valid.
    	   	
    	Classes used from the geom namespace
    	  - Body_Ident_Base
    	  - Reference_Frame_Ident
    	  - Central_Body_Ident
    	  - Display_Direction
    	  
    	Classes used from the pds namespace
    	  - Internal_Reference

    	Attributes used from the pds namespace
    	  - local_identifier_reference
    	  - sampling_parameter_name
    	  - sampling_parameter_unit
    	  - sampling_parameter_interval
    	  - description
    	  - name     (indirectly via classes from the geom namespace)
    	  - comment  (indirectly via classes from the geom namespace)

   description            observed_event_time indicates the instant at which photons were received at the instrument. As a field in an occultation profile table, it is given in numeric seconds as an offset from the specified UTC reference time. The reference time is preferably the start of a day. In a label the corresponding time interval end point values are given by the required start_date_time_utc and stop_date_time_utc attributes in the Time_Coordinates class.

It is always the photon arrival time, so in this regard we treat typical spacecraft radio occultation data as Earth-based, referring to the time at the DSN receiving station. For an uplink radio occultation, this is the spacecraft event time. Note: For occultation data, PDS prefers year-month-day format for dates rather than year plus day-of-year format.

   description            light_source_incidence_angle is an angle measured from the local surface normal vector to the direction of a photon arriving from the light source. For rings, the normal vector is that on the same side of the rings as the light source, so values always range between 0 and 90 in units of degrees. The value is always equal to 90 - | observed_ring_elevation | This will enable users to perform database searches based on the effective ring opening angle when they are not concerned about the distinction between north-side and southside viewpoints. We have included the 'light source' prefix to the term so that this quantity is not confused with 'incidence angle', a term that is generally associated with sunlight rather than stars or radio transmitters. Required in the label if the value is constant for the observation. If the angle varies for the observation, the min and max attributes are required in the label.
