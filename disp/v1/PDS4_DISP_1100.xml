                <description>This version of the Display dictionary,
                    1.1.0.0, is built against version 1.1.0.1 of the
                    PDS4 common model.  This version of the dictionary
                    is NOT backwards compatible with the previous
                    version.  The following updates have been made:
                    
                    1) A super class, named Display_Settings, has been
                       added.  It is intended as a container for all
                       the display related classes within the
                       Discipline_Area of a label.
                    
                    2) The local_identifier_reference attribute has
                       been replaced with a Local_Internal_Reference
                       class.  It has been pulled out of the
                       Default_Display_Settings_* classes and promoted
                       up to the Display_Settings class.
                    
                    3) The Default_Display_Settings class has been
                       renamed to Display_Direction.  It's description
                       has been updated to reflect that the directional
                       attributes are not suggestions but instructions
                       on the correct display of an image.
                    
                    4) The Default_Display_Settings_Color,
                       Default_Display_Settings_Movie, and
                       Default_Display_Settings_Color_Movie classes
                       have been replaced by the Color_Display_Settings
                       and Movie_Display_Settings classes.  The latter
                       are no longer extensions of another class but
                       stand alone on their own.  Each contains only
                       those attributes related to color or video
                       content, respectively.  One or more of these
                       classes may be used to describe a digital Array
                       object, as needed.
                    
                    5) Four enumerated values changed in version 1.1
                       have been changed back to (roughly) their 1.0
                       values:
                       
                       Right --> Left to Right
                       Left  --> Right to Left
                       Down  --> Top to Bottom
                       Up    --> Bottom to Top
                       
                       Corresponding changes were made to the min_chars
                       and max_chars values of the attributes.
                    
                    6) The extraneous conditional portion of some test
                       statements in the Schematron file has been
                       removed.
                    
                    7) The included project file has been re-configured
                       to automatically load the XML catalog file.

                <description>This version of the Display dictionary,
                    v1.0.0.4, makes a number of changes:
                    
                    1) It updates the descriptions of the dictionary
                       and its classes to make it clearer that the
                       included attributes describe display parameters
                       only, and are not to be presumed to be
                       scientifically accurate.
                    
                    2) It attempts, unsuccessfully, to utilize the PDS
                       common "comment" attribute, rather than
                       recreating that attribute in the local
                       namespace, as was done in the previous version. 
                       Further work will have to be required to get
                       this to work properly.
                    
                    3) With the exception of the boolean "true" and
                       "false" values, all enumerated values have been
                       changed from lower case to "Title" case, in
                       accordance with CCB-22, "Adopt Rules for Case of
                       Enumerated Values".
                    
                    4) Four enumerated values have been changed:
                       
                       Left_to_Right --> Right
                       Right_to_Left --> Left
                       Top_to_Bottom --> Down
                       Bottom_to_Top --> Up
                       
                       Corresponding changes were made to the min_chars
                       and max_chars values of the attributes.
                    
                    5) A spelling mistake in the definitions of the
                       red_, green_, and blue_channel_bands has been
                       corrected: "deafult" --> "default".

                <description>This version of the Display dictionary,
                    v1.0.0.3, was released to the DDWG for review,
                    before distribution to a broader community.  It
                    includes the Default_Display_Settings class and
                    three subclasses to handle color images, movies,
                    and color movies.
