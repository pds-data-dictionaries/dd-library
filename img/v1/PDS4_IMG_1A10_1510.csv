Thus lower values of segment_quality correspond to higher reconstructed qualities, and a value of indicates lossless compression. Note that the compressed stream does not directly contain the value of min loss that was given to the compressor, but the decompressor does know how far along in the decompression process it got before it ran out of bits; this information is used to determine segment_quality. In rare circumstances the decompressor m ay not be able to determine segment_quality for a segment that it decompresses. In this case it sets segment_quality to 1.0.
