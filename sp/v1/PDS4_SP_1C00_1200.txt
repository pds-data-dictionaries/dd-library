        This is a complete re-write of the Spectral Dictionary version 1.1.0.0  (i.e., PDS4_SP_1100, 
        released with core IM 1.4.0.0) to bring it into compliance with requirements and best practices 
        established since the original version was created.  
        
        Existing attribute definitions have been reviewed and in some cases updated.  This should be 
        reflected in the version_id value of the attribute.
        
        The "submitter_name" of "ACR" indicates Anne (C.) Raugh.

   description             The bin_center_field_name must contain the value of a 'name' attribute of a Field defined in the referenced Table object. This named Field contains the bin center information for each row in a 1D spectrum presented in tabular form. It will have units (and possibly offset and scaling factor) as indicated in the Field definition. This will usually be accompanied by a bin_width_field_name.

   description             The bin_width_field_name must contain the value of a 'name' attribute of a Field defined in the referenced Table object. This named Field contains the bin width information for each row in a 1D spectrum presented in tabular form. It will have units (and possibly offset and scaling factor) as indicated in the Field definition. This attribute must be accompanied by a bin_center_field_name. If bin widths are constant or unknown, use the Bin_Width_Constant class to specify this.

   value data type        ASCII_NonNegative_Integer
   description             The grating_position attribute of a spectral cube describes the grating position which corresponds to the band. Grating positions are usually assigned consecutively from 0, and increasing position causes increasing wavelength for each detector.

   version                1.12
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description             The net_integration_time for a spectrum is the total integration time per pixel. For many detectors (CCDs, for example), all pixels are exposed simultaneously, so this value will correspond to the observation interval. In some cases, however, an instrument will sweep across pixels, rows, or planes, so that the observation period may be substantially longer than the actual integration time contributing to the individual pixels. 
   minimum value          5.0e-324
   unit of measure type   Units_of_Time

   name                   number_of_exposures

      wavelength -  The spectrum is sampled in the wavelength domain, and all binning parameters will be in length units.

   name                   spectrum_format
   version                1.12
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description             The spectrum_format attribute is required to define the specific dimensionality of the structure or substructure that contains the intensity values. 
   permissible value - value meaning
      1D -  Linear spectrum - each row of the table contains the information for one bin (one point) on the spectrum. You must specify the name of the field containing the intensity information. 
      2D -  The spectrum is presented as a 2D array - an image. 
      3D -  The spectra are presented as a 3D array, each plane containing a 2D spectrum. 
      Tabulated-Flat -  The spectra are presented as a table in which each row contains a single spectrum, and the individual spectral points and related parameters are each defined by separated Field definitions - that is, no Group_Field classes are used in defining the spectral data format. In this case, all Fields containing spectral data or bin parameters must have field_number attributes. 
      Tabulated-Parameter Groups -  The spectra are presented as a table in which each row contains a single spectrum, and Group_Field classes are used to define the fields corresponding to the spectral values, bin centers, and bin widths (if present). Each Group_Field must contain only a single parameter - in other words, the spectral values a stored contiguously within the record, the bin centers are stored contiguously within the record, etc. In this case, the Group_Field classes containing the spectral values, bin centers, and bin widths (when present) must contain only a single Field that is repeated. 
      Tabulated-Point Group -  The spectra are presented as a table in which each row contains a single spectrum, and a single Group_Field class is used to define the value and all related parameters at a single spectral point. In this case, the same Group_Field class must contain the spectral value, bin center, and bin width (when present) for each point in the spectrum.

   description             The value_field_number_list attribute is used only in the case spectra in the format "Tabulated-Flat", where each row of a table contains a spectrum and the spectral points are defined as individual Fields - one Field defined for each point. The format is a parenthesized, ordered list of the field_number values from the Field definitions that correspond to the spectral values.

It provides a way to specify a nominal constant width or indicate that there is no available information about the bin width. If the bin width is completely unknown, use the appropriate bin_width attribute for the spectral type (frequency, wavelength, or wavenumber), and indicate that it is nil, with a reason of "unknown". When this class is used, a full explanation of the situation should be provided by the bin_width_desc attribute of the parent class.

In general, this class should be present, and all parameters applicable to the situation should be included, even though optional. In some complex cases or for high-level derived products this class may not be applicable, in which case it may be omitted. Use the 'comment' attribute to describe any special circumstances users should be aware of.
